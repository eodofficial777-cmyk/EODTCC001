/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a mixed security model tailored for a role-playing game application.
 * It combines a strict user-ownership model for player-specific data with a global read-only model for common game data.
 * Administrative privileges are managed via a database-as-access-control (DBAC) collection.
 *
 * Data Structure: Player-specific data, such as user profiles, characters, and activity logs, is nested
 * under the `/users/{userId}` path. This structure leverages path-based security to ensure players can only
 * access their own information. Global game data, like factions, races, items, and skills, is stored in
 * top-level collections, making it easily accessible for all clients.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User Data Privacy: All documents under `/users/{userId}` are strictly private and can only be accessed by the owning user.
 * - Public Game Data: Core game assets (items, factions, skills, etc.) are publicly readable to allow the client application
 *   to function correctly. However, all write operations on this data are restricted to administrators.
 * - Admin Roles: A user is considered an administrator if a document with their UID exists in the `/roles_admin` collection.
 *   This DBAC approach avoids custom claims and allows for dynamic role management.
 * - No User Listing: Listing the entire `/users` collection is explicitly forbidden to protect user privacy.
 * - Denormalization for Authorization: User-owned documents (like Characters and Tasks) are expected to contain a `userId` field
 *   that matches the `userId` in the path. This is validated on creation and enforced as immutable on update, ensuring
 *   relational integrity without costly `get()` calls in rules.
